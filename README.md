# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the completed code for a project: Students have forked and cloned this repository from <https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter>, then built upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

This completed product could not have been done without the help of the Lighthouse Lab Mentors and the other students in the cohort.
